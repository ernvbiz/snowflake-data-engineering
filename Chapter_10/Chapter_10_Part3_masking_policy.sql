-- to keep the exercise simple, the DATA_ENGINEER role creates and applies masking policies
-- grant privileges to create and apply masking policies to the DATA_ENGINEER role
use role ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- create a masking policy that masks the addr column when the current role is not DATA_ENGINEER
create masking policy ADDRESS_MASK

-- to test, use one of the data analyst roles
-- should return masked data

-- then use the DATA_ENGINEER role
